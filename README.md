# Time and Essence

Time and Essence (**TnE**) is a lowcode/codeless "mod" that aims to both be an example of the flexibilty of DnE's data-driven progression and guidebook, and to balance out Tempad's rather... *interesting* recipe choices with Data and Essence progression and materials.

All of this, of course, requires **Data**. **Data** which is found in Ancient structures, buildings forgotten by the world...

## Chronospatial Labs
The **Chronospatial Labs** are the source of all the Ancient's research into devices for moving through time and space - an area of study they called **Spatiotemporal Conveyances**. Within the Labs, you will find several reseach areas. Some abandoned, their projects canceled long before their time...

And others filled with strange machinery, its purpose unknown

The doors are sealed shut, but perhaps there's a way in?

The Labs were closed long ago, but puzzles were left behind for the interprid researcher to find and enter those ancient halls once again

But beware, for not all are welcome...
